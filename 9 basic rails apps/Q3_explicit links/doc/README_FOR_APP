Q3 answer 
Yes is it is possible to move between pages without haveing to select an explicit link
As can be seen in the name.html.erb file it is possible for the user to select the submit_tag send which is not an explicit link
and be brought to the mathod saveName which then displays the page saveName.html.erb
