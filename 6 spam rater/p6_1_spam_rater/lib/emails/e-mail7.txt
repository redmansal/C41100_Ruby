Hi all,

I've organised an event for Thursday, 10th November. I booked half of the Astra Hall in the Student Centre, and obtained an alcohol license for the evening.
This means we can all bring our own alcohol into the Astra Hall on 10th November. I'm hoping this date is far away enough to allow notice, and not too close to exams to be suitable.
The Hall is booked from 8PM - 10PM, but we should be able to go there from 7.30PM.
Afterwards, I'm booking an area in Vanilla in Donnybrook (although if this doesn't prove suitable the venue may change). 

We're all allowed to bring two drinks each, and they must be either wine, beer, or cider. Spirits are not permitted. 
The Entertainment Officer of the Student Union will also provide every person with a free drink from the bar.

I'll send more details later on, just wanted to let you know the date as soon as I knew it. I'm inviting the other conversion course who have just started, to allow a bit of interaction between the classes!

Best Wishes,
Ursula
